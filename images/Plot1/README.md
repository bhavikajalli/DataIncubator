# Plot1
### Motivation
The first plot is analysed using the Mentions Network. The nodes (V) of the graphs are the users and the edges (E) are established by connecting the user and all the other users that were mentioned in the tweet. I then used this network to find meaningful communities. The intuition here is that people supporting what the others have said tend to mention them in their tweets and hence belong to the same community.

### Analysis
The Green community consists of news outlets, journalists, writers, and columnists. The members post neutral tweets about the event that are mostly informational content. 
The Red community consists of users with conservative views who are politically right leaning with tweets indicating a dismissive view towards the \#MeToo event. 
Finally, the Blue community consists of women specific organizations, activists and liberal thinkers with extreme support to the event.
