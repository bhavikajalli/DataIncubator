# Plot2
### Motivation
The second plot is analysed using the Re-tweet Network. the nodes are the users (V) and the edge (E) connect the user and the re-tweeted user. This Re-tweet network has 294,230 nodes and 395,340 edges. It is inferred that the communities detected in the the Re-tweet network represents much stronger connection as re-tweeting a user would mean direct agreement or disagreement to the content. The communities formed here will be based on direct relationships.

### Analysis 
The relationships in the Re-tweet network imply a direct connection between the users and that the membership in each community is exclusive. The members in the community display a strong binding.
